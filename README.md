# Fiancial-Fraud-Detection
Preventing financial fraud is a critical concern for financial institutions as it can cause significant losses for both the institution and its customers. Predicting fraudulent activities can help banks and financial institutions develop more effective risk management strategies, such as strengthening their security measures, identifying high-risk accounts, and implementing fraud detection tools.

Using machine learning algorithms, financial institutions can analyze a wide range of factors, such as transaction history, account activity, and customer behavior, to detect patterns that may indicate fraudulent activity. With Gradient Boosting algorithms, we can create a predictive model that can accurately identify fraudulent transactions, helping institutions take proactive measures to prevent financial losses.
